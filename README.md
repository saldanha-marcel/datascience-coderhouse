# The Dataset 

Two datasets are included, related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests

The data is from website UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository base [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality).
